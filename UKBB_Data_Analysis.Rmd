### Foreword

This RMarkdown document details the data analysis plan for the paper of: 

"Holistic Prediction of the Longitudinal Rate of Cognitive Decline: An Aōtearoa New Zealand Perspective" (Title subject to change).

In recent years, Alzheimer's disease (the predominant cause of accelerated cognitive decline and dementia) has overtaken cancer as the most feared disease in the general population, and is quickly becoming the leading health issue of the century (Patterson, 2018). 

### Mission Statement

In a prospective analytic design, the proposed study has two objectives. Firstly, we aim to analyse the predictors of an individual's rate of cognitive decline during middle to older ageing. Promisingly, this may evince future hypotheses regarding the causal mechanisms of dementia inclusive disease, and the targets of preventative treatments. Our second objective is to create and evaluate a multidimensional predictive model that explores how accurately we can predict the rate at which an individual will cognitively decline during ageing. These objectives will be achieved utilising state of the art statistical and machine learning methods to explore the largest and most holistic collection of cognitively relevant variables to date. Notably including physiological, neural, demographic, cognitive, physical activity, diet, lifestyle, mental health, physical health, sleep, and social factors from the UKBiobank. Additionally, in evaluating our findings it will be discussed how these key factors of cognitive health in the Western European context may and may not correlate with mātauranga Māori knowledge for the determinants of cognitive health in an Aōtearoa New Zealand context.

### Participant Details

The UK Biobank is a large prospective cohort that aims to improve prevention, diagnosis and treatment of age-associated pathologies (https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/). During recruitment (2006 - 2010), 502,356 participants aged 37-73 years from the United Kingdom (UK), provided informed consent for use of their anonymised data and health records for future health-related research. Ethical approval for the UK Biobank was provided by both the National Information Governance Board for Health and Social Care and the Northwest Multicentre Research Ethics Committee (11/NW/0382). 

Participants attended a UK assessment centre up to four times, providing data through verbal interviews, clinical measurements (including brain MRI, blood and urine assays) and touchscreen questionnaires. Data were collected on demographic, cognitive, physical activity, diet, lifestyle, mental health, physical health, sleep, and social factors. In addition, health records were accessed, providing information on participants' medical history, family medical history, and medication history. From each of these domains, 'phenotype' measures with potential relevance for cognitive decline will be included in the current study (see below for a full list), with approved access under UK Biobank data application 70132-21042. 

With the exception of cognitive outcome variables (utilised at two timepoints), if a given variable was collected at multiple instances, only the first instance will be used in the proposed study, ensuring that we meet assumptions of independence. The only exclusion criteria is missing data (as all variables of interest will be modelled). However, the full cohort has varied amounts of missing data between variables. Consequently, univariate analyses will utilise all pairwise complete observations for each association, leading to a mean sample size of 55,482. However, for multivariate analyses, complete observations are required across variables and the sample size is yet to be determined.

### Cognitive Decline Outcome Measures

The cognitive functioning phenotypes detailed above are the outcome variables of interest for each of the following analyses. These measures of cognitive performance provide participants' performance on seven tests: Reaction time test (simple processing speed), numeric memory test (working memory), pairs matching test (episodic memory), fluid intelligence test (fluid intelligence), picture vocabulary test (crytallised intelligence), trail making test (executive function), symbol digit substitution test (complex processing speed). 

The rate of decline for each cognitive outcome will be calculated as follows:

<center>
**γdn = scaled(∆Score/∆Time)**
</center>

Where the rate of decline (γ) for a given cognitive domain (d) in a given participant
(n) is calculated from the standardised (subtract mean and divide by standard
deviation of the sample difference in score per year).

### Calculating the Rate of Overall Cognitive Decline

Additionally, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) will be trained on the baseline cognitive performance scores in each test to produce a single factor model of the overall cognitive functioning (g-factor) of each participant at baseline. This model will be applied (with fixed loadings) to the follow-up cognitive performance scores to calculate the overall cognitive functioning of each participant at follow-up. 

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(psych)
library(lavaan)

# Load in dfs 
baseline_cog_df = read.csv("baseline_cog_df.csv", header = TRUE)
followup_cog_df = read.csv("followup_cog_df.csv", header = TRUE)
time_diff_df = read.csv("time_diff_df.csv", header = TRUE)

# Clean data: Remove rows with NA values
baseline_cog_df_clean <- na.omit(baseline_cog_df)
followup_cog_df_clean <- na.omit(followup_cog_df)

# Ensure follow-up data has the same columns as baseline data
followup_cog_df_clean <- followup_cog_df_clean[, colnames(baseline_cog_df_clean), drop = FALSE]

# Extract the mean and sd from the cleaned baseline data
baseline_means <- colMeans(baseline_cog_df_clean)
baseline_sds <- apply(baseline_cog_df_clean, 2, sd)

# Scale baseline data
baseline_cog_df_scaled <- scale(baseline_cog_df_clean)

# Scale follow-up data using baseline scale parameters
followup_cog_df_scaled <- sweep(followup_cog_df_clean, 2, baseline_means, FUN = "-")
followup_cog_df_scaled <- sweep(followup_cog_df_scaled, 2, baseline_sds, FUN = "/")

# Drop unnecessary columns and match dimensions
baseline_cog_df_scaled2 <- baseline_cog_df_scaled[,-14] # Adjust as necessary
followup_cog_df_scaled <- followup_cog_df_scaled[,-14] # Adjust as necessary
followup_cog_df_scaled <- followup_cog_df_scaled[1:(dim(followup_cog_df_scaled)[1] - 4),]

# Print dimensions for debugging
print(dim(followup_cog_df_scaled))  # Check dimensions of scaled follow-up data
print(dim(loadings))                # Check dimensions of loadings

# Perform EFA on baseline data to extract a single factor model
efa_baseline <- fa(baseline_cog_df_scaled2, nfactors = 1, rotate = "varimax")

# Get factor loadings from EFA
loadings <- efa_baseline$loadings
# BASELINE LOADINGS
print(loadings)

# Calculate g-factor scores at each time point
g_factor_baseline <- efa_baseline$scores
g_factor_followup <- as.matrix(followup_cog_df_scaled) %*% as.matrix(loadings)

# Print results to verify
print(head(g_factor_followup))

```
```{r}
ROCD_df = read.csv("ROCD_df.csv", header = TRUE)
ROCD_df$ROCD.g.factor[ROCD_df$ROCD.g.factor == 0] <- NA
scaled_ROCD_df = scale(ROCD_df)
scaled_ROCD_df = as.data.frame(scaled_ROCD_df)
```

The main limitation to this approach is that the loadings
of each cognitive test on the g-factor measure could change between time points.
Consequently, the validity of the factor structure identified at baseline will be tested on the follow-up cognitive performance data using a confirmatory factor analysis. This allows for model fit to be analysed, as well as tests for measurement invariance across time points. 

```{r}
library(readr)
library(semTools)
# Combine baseline and follow-up data
combined_data <- rbind(
  data.frame(time_point = "baseline", baseline_cog_df_scaled2),
  data.frame(time_point = "followup", followup_cog_df_scaled))

combined_data = combined_data[,-15]
# Define CFA model
cfa_model <- 'g_factor =~ Trail.Making.Test.Speed..A. + Trail.Making.Test.Speed..B. + Trail.Making.Test.Errors..A. + Trail.Making.Test.Errors..B. + Symbol.digit.matches.made.correctly + Symbol.digit.matches.attempted + Pairs.Matching.Speed.1 + Pairs.Matching.Speed.2 + Pairs.Matching.Errors.1 + Pairs.Matching.Errors.2 + Numeric.Memory + Fluid.intelligence + Reaction.Time' 

# Configural invariance
fit_configural <- cfa(cfa_model, data = combined_data, group = 'time_point')

# Metric invariance
fit_metric <- cfa(cfa_model, data = combined_data, group = 'time_point', group.equal = 'loadings')

# Scalar invariance
fit_scalar <- cfa(cfa_model, data = combined_data, group = 'time_point', group.equal = c('loadings', 'intercepts'))

# Compare models
model_comparisons = compareFit(fit_configural, fit_metric, fit_scalar)
summary(model_comparisons)

# Omnibus invariance testing
measurementInvariance(model = cfa_model, data = combined_data, group = "time_point")

summary(fit_configural)
```



The calculated g-factor scores will then be used to model the rate of overall cognitive decline using a mixed-effects model. This allows us to account for variability in the follow-up period among participants and to provide more robust estimates of the longitudinal changes in the validated g-factor scores for each individual.

```{r}
# save the g_factor scores as dfs
write.csv(g_factor_baseline, file="g_factor_baseline.csv")
write.csv(g_factor_followup, file="g_factor_followup.csv")

# Calculate the difference in g-factor scores
g_factor_difference <- g_factor_followup - g_factor_baseline

# Create a data frame for the mixed-effects model
mixed_model_data <- data.frame(
  participant = rep(1:nrow(baseline_cog_df), 2),
  time_point = rep(c("baseline", "followup"), each = nrow(baseline_cog_df)),
  g_factor = c(g_factor_baseline, g_factor_followup),
  time_diff_online = c(rep(0, nrow(baseline_cog_df)), time_diff_df$time_diff_online),
  time_diff_centre = c(rep(0, nrow(baseline_cog_df)), time_diff_df$time_diff_centre)
)


# Using the lme4 package for mixed-effects models
library(lme4)
library(lmerTest)
Mxdmodel <- lmer(g_factor ~ time_point * time_diff_online + time_point * time_diff_centre + (1 | participant), data = mixed_model_data)
summary(Mxdmodel)

# Extract random effects (including slopes)
random_effects <- ranef(Mxdmodel)

# Random slopes for time_point for each participant
annual_change_g <- random_effects$participant[, "time_pointfollowup"]


```


This approach, involving EFA, CFA, and mixed-effects modeling, is commonly used in cognitive psychology and related fields. Notably, EFA has been used previously to identify underlying factors in the UKBiobank cognitive performance data (Fawns-Ritchie & Deary, 2020; Ciobanu et al., 2023). However, structural equation modelling (SEM) may be used additionally if the initial EFA/CFA factor models prove to be unstable across time. SEM would allow us to handle measurement invariance across time points by incorporating both individual and temporal variability into the model, while considering measurement error.

### Univariate pairwise association analyses

The first objective of the proposed study is to analyse the predictors of an individual's rate of cognitive decline during middle to older ageing. To achieve this objective, univariate pairwise associations will be analysed between non-categorical phenotypes (from all measured aspects of participants’ holistic health (hauora)) and the rate of cognitive decline (for each cognitive subdomain and overall). Pearson correlation r and p values will be calculated.

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(psych)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(tibble)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(reshape2)
library(ggcorrplot)
library(plotly)  # For interactive plots

# Load the data
univar_df <- read.csv("univar_df.csv", header = TRUE)

# make sure to select only continuous variables
is_discrete   <- function(vec) all(is.numeric(univar_df)) && all(univar_df %% 1 == 0)
is_continuous <- function(vec) all(is.numeric(vec)) && !is_discrete(vec)
continuous_univar_df <- univar_df %>%
        select(where(is_continuous))


# Standardise all variables in 'univar_df'
scaled_univar_df = scale(continuous_univar_df)

# convert the matrix into dataframe 
scaled_univar_df =as.data.frame(scaled_univar_df)

# remove cognitive vars from scaled_univar_df
scaled_univar_df = scaled_univar_df[,-c(21:63)]
write.csv(scaled_univar_df, file="scaled_univar_df.csv")
```

As the phenotype data were collected in many different units, both variables in each association will be standardised to allow Pearson correlation r values to be interpreted as the effect size. Pearson correlation assumes that variables are normally distributed and have linear relationships. Non-linear relationships or non-normally distributed variables might not be well captured using this method. Consequently, for non-normal variables the non-parametric Spearman's rank correlation will be used instead. 

Due to the large sample size of the UKBiobank, it is likely that even with a weak effect size (small r value), consistent and true effects may be detectable as a significant p-value. Consequently, p-values will be used to identify the strongest associations. However, there are varying amounts of missing data across measures, so the resulting associations will have highly varied degrees of freedom. Findings will be displayed using conventional Manhattan plots of –log10(P) and heatmaps visualising the direction and strength (meaningfulness) of relationships in the correlation matrix. An example Manhattan plot is shown below in Figure 1 for reference. Both the significance and strength and direction of effect size will be utilised in interpreting associations. Additionally, a full table of significant associations will be ordered and displayed in supplementary materials. 

Multiple comparison correction will be completed for the full set of (a to be determined number of) correlations by adjusting the significance threshold. This will be completed using a highly conservative Bonferroni correction for family-wise error control at Pcorrected < 0.05, corresponding to a -log10(Puncorrected) of (TBC).

### Multivariate Analysis: Elastic Net

The second objective of the proposed study is to create and evaluate a multidimensional predictive model that explores how accurately we can predict the rate at which an individual will cognitively decline during ageing. To achieve this, we will use an elastic net, a regularised regression method with a combination of the LASSO (providing feature selection) and ridge regression (providing mutual regularisation) penalty terms. Crucially for this investigation, the elastic net handles multicollinearity well whilst minimising the bias-variance trade-off. This method gains the interpretability of linear regression, allowing us to include both categorical and non-categorical phenotypes, and observe the unique effect (regarding the variables we have analysed) of each phenotype on the rate of cognitive decline (for each cognitive subdomain and overall).

The elastic net will be cast on an 80/20 train-test split where all phenotypes and rate of cognitive decline outcome measures are standardised. 10-fold cross-validation will be used to optimise the hyperparameters (alpha and lambda) for the elastic net model, reducing the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, assumptions of linearity, independence of residuals, and homoscedasticity will be tested using a scatterplot of the residual vs. fitted values, a Durbin-Watson test and a Breusch-Pagan test respectively. Additionally, the models predictive performance will be evaluated using RMSE and R^2 metrics. Nevertheless, regularised regression methods can still be susceptible to biased solutions caused by the inclusion of a regularisation term that may produce differing results in the case of multicollinearity. Conservatively, to increase the certainty and robustness of our estimates, bootstrapping (i.e., re-sampling with replacement 1,000 times) will be used to generate a distribution of coefficients for each predictor variable. Phenotypes with bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals that do not overlap zero will be considered informative for the prediction of cognitive decline.
